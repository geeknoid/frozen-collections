# TODOs

Things to do in the short term:

- Test coverage
- Add some diagnostics to encourage users to use the specialized facades
- Would be nice if it was possible to assign the output of the macros and/or facades to a static
- Would be nice to support libcore
- When there are duplicate keys, report what they are and in macros, where they are
